TagFlow is a simple and effective tool designed to automate the process of inserting tags on platforms like **SoundCloud** and other websites where a large amount of repetitive data entry is required. The program saves time by automating the insertion of tags, which is especially useful when uploading a large number of tracks or other content.

## üí° Project History

The idea for TagFlow came to me when I was uploading audio to **SoundCloud**. I realized that each time I posted new audio, I had to manually enter the same tags over and over again. This was not only inconvenient but also time-consuming. I found myself repeating the same actions constantly, and that‚Äôs when I decided to automate the process.

That's how **TagFlow** was born ‚Äî an easy-to-use tool for quickly inserting and managing tags, with customizable themes and keyboard shortcuts.

## üìã Features

- **Automatic tag insertion**: The program automatically inserts tags from a predefined list stored in a text file. This eliminates the need to manually enter the same data.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Supports hotkeys for quick tag insertion (e.g., press F4 to insert the next tag).
- **Theme customization**: You can change the interface theme for a more personalized experience.
- **File management**: Tag data is stored in a text file that can be easily updated and configured.
- **User-friendly interface**: Simple to use, no technical knowledge required to get started.

## üõ† Installation

### Requirements:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries: `keyboard`, `pyperclip`, `watchdog`, `tkinter`, `PIL`
